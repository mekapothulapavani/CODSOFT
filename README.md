Choose the projects that align with your interests and embark on your journey in the fascinating field of data science.

## Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

### Task

Building a model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This classic beginner project utilizes the Titanic dataset, containing information such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status. Explore data analysis, feature engineering, and classification techniques to make predictions about passenger survival.

## Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction with Python

### Task

Developing a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. Use regression techniques to analyze historical movie data and accurately estimate movie ratings. This project involves data analysis, preprocessing, and feature engineering, providing insights into the factors influencing movie ratings.

## Task 3: Iris Flower Classification

### Task

Training a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements. This introductory classification task uses the Iris dataset, offering an opportunity to practice classification algorithms and explore feature importance.

## Task 4: Sales Prediction Using Python

### Task

Forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase by leveraging machine learning techniques. Consider factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection. Dive into sales prediction, a crucial aspect of businesses offering products or services, and optimize advertising strategies for maximizing sales potential.

## Task 5: Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Task

Building a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Preprocess and normalize transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and split the dataset for training and testing. Utilize classification algorithms, such as logistic regression or random forests, and evaluate model performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. Explore techniques like oversampling or undersampling to enhance results.
